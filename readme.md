## Master's project

## Requirements

- OpenGL 4.5
- MS Visual Studio 2022

## Build steps

Once you have cloned the repository, make sure to do the following steps.

1. Unzip the Dependencies.zip file (it was zipped due to the size being over 100 MB)
2. Once you open the .sln file, make sure the configuration is set to Debug + Win32(x86) (might get updated later to work on Release too)
3. In case you run into any problem, take a look at the following section (Troubleshooting problems)

## Troubleshooting problems
There are several things to keep in mind when the program isn't able to execute or throws an exception.

1. Check whether there is a message in the command line. I tried to print out a message before throwing an exception to see what might be the issue
2. If you find any issues, forward them to me and I will put it up here until it is fixed.
